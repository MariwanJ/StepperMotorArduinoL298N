# StepperMotorArduinoL298N
Using L298 as a controller for driving stepper motor. I couldn't find any version of Arduino library that uses L298N. Pleaes report any bug you find or any improvements you suggest.
The origional code is written by HomoFaciens at http://www.homofaciens.de/technics-machines-cnc-v2_en.htm.
I modified that part which is related to the controller connected to the Arduino. In this case it is the L298N. 
I needed to use the Analog pins as digital. This code is not tested with a real CNC. I tested with stepper motors and they run fine. But further test might be needed. 
Let me know if you have any suggestions. 

Note: Special thanks go to the owner of the origional code (homofaciens.de).
